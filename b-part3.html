        Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine
        players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game is live when
        the umpire signals to the pitcher either verbally or by pointing,
        indicating that the ball is now in play. A player on the fielding team,
        called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team
        tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting
        team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other
        team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them
        advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called
        "runs". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding
        team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent
        runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally
        advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place
        where the player started as a batter).
